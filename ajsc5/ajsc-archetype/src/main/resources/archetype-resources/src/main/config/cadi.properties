#In order to test functionality of cadi-ajsc-plugin locally cross domain cookie. Cadi "should" find your hostname for you. 
#However, we have seen some situations where this fails. A Local testing
#modification can include modifying your hosts file so that you can use "mywebserver.att.com" for your localhost in order
#to test/verify GLO functionality locally. If you are on a Windows machine, you will already have a machine name associated with 
#it that will utilize an AT&T domain such as "sbc.com". You may need to add your  domain to this as a comma separated list depending
#upon your particular machine domain. This property is commented out as cadi SHOULD find your machine name. With version 1.2.1 of cadi, 
#it appears to resolve Mac machine names as well, now. But, this can be somewhat inconsistent depending on your specific working envrironment.
