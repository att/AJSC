 * <p>
 * Each port (nic) is assigned a MAC (Media Access Control) address that represents that NIC uniquely on the media.
 * Media in this case is the virtual cable or fiber that would have been connected to the physical server.

 * Each port can also be assigned one or more IP addresses. This allows a server to be addressable as different values
