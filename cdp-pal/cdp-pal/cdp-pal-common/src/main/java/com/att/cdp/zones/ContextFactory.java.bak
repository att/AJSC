/**
 * The client of the rime API uses this factory object to obtain an initialized context to a specific provider instance.
 * <p>
 * The context factory dynamically locates all RIME providers and makes them available to the client. The client
 * requests a context object for a specific provider. The context object allows the client to access that provider's
 * services and to make requests of that provider. The operation of locating the provider and obtaining a context is
 * combined into one factory method {@link com.att.cdp.zones.ContextFactory#getContext(String, Properties)}. The client
 * does not interface with the provider object directly, although they can obtain access to the provider from any
 * context object that it creates.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The context must be located using a provider name, and an optional properties object. The name is used to locate the
 * provider implementation. Providers may be created and added to the class path. These providers publish their
 * existence using the Java {@link ServiceLoader} facility. The way this works is that provider implementations must
 * implement the {@link Provider} interface and explicitly name the class that implements that interface in a resource
 * file named <code>com.att.cdp.zones.Provider</code> located under <code>/META-INF/services</code>. The file name of
 * the resource file is the fully qualified name of the {@link Provider} interface. The file is a text file that simply
 * contains the fully qualified class name that implements the interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link ServiceLoader} simply scans the class path for all implementations and returns them using an iterator. The
 * context factory loads the provider properties (a set of default and configuration properties for each provider) and
 * checks the provider name against the name requested. When a provider is found that matches the name requested, that
 * provider is used to create the configured context.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Providers may need information from the client in order to configure a context. The exact type and content of this
 * information may vary from one provider to another. Additionally, some providers may be able to initialize themselves,
 * maybe only partially, from default values. Therefore, the framework allows for default properties (stored in the
 * <code>Provider.properties</code> resource file) to be merged with optional properties that the client may supply, and
 * also merge with the system properties. By merging all of these properties together, it provides the ability for
 * command-line overrides of configuration settings.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The merged properties are then used to configure the specific context. Once configured, each context maintains a
 * reference to the merged properties object that was used to configure them. This allows these properties to be queried
 * after instantiation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An example of client code that requests a specific provider and initializes a context is shown below. By convention,
 * the properties required by a specific provider are defined as public constants in that class or interface.
 * </p>

 * properties.setProperty(Context.PROPERTY_TENANT_NAME, tenant);
